My npm template I like ❤️. One step further from ```npm init``` preconfig by standard building configurations and tools. No unnecessary and weird stuffs.

## What it does?
- preinstall ```nvmrc```, ```babelrc``` and ```eslintrc``` 
- ```npm start``` and ```npm build``` script

## English please.
- Latest ES6 features including module syntax
- Human readable error messages

## My opinion configurations.
- Airbnb linting rules.
- Disable camelCase linting rule.

## How to
1. Clone this repo.
2. ```npm i``` or ```yarn```
3. 😀
