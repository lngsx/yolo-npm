# yolo-npm
My npm template I like ‚ù§Ô∏è. One step further from ```npm init```. Preconfig by standard building configurations and tools. No unnecessary and weird stuffs.

## What it does?
- preinstall ```nvmrc```, ```babelrc``` and ```eslintrc``` 
- preinstall ```npm start``` and ```npm build``` script

## English please.
- Latest ES6 features including module syntax
- Human readable error messages

## My opinion configurations.
- Airbnb linting rules.
- Disable camelCase linting rule.

## How to
1. Clone this repo.
2. ```npm i``` or ```yarn```
3. üòÄ

## Bonus
1. open ```.zshrc``` or ```rc``` file you are using.
2. add ```'git clone https://github.com/luangch/yolo-npm.git'``` as an alias. For example, ```alias yolo='git clone https://github.com/luangch/yolo-npm.git'```
3. Now you can do ```yolo my_experiment_app```. ```cd``` in and do ```npm install``` or ```yarn```

## To do
- Sourcemap
